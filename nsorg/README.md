If the comment starts with `fix $action_name` or `fix nsorg`, a new commit will
be added to the branch with the automated fixes applied.

## Example workflow

```hcl
workflow "on push" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["nsorg"]
}

# Used for fix on review
# Don't enable if you plan using autofix on push
# Or there might be race conditions
workflow "on review" {
  resolves = ["nsorg"]
  on = "pull_request_review"
}

action "nsorg" {
  uses = "m45t3r/actions/nsorg@master"
  # Enable autofix on push and exclude a broken file from lint
  # args = [
  #   "autofix",
  #   "--exclude src/my_project/broken_file.clj"
  # ]
  # Used for pushing changes for `fix` comments on review
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
